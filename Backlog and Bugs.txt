For this delivery, we have a partially completed game. So far in our backlog we have completed:
* Movement with both arrow keys and wasd
* Dash and double jump movement
* Level design of a tutorial
* Level design of second level
* Enemies that can detect when the player is in view and bring the player into combat
* Combat where the player and enemy can attack each-other
* Health that carries over from battle
* Bushes that the player can hide in
* A pause menu where you can toggle the controls 
* A splash screen menu
* Polished enemy/player sprites
* Buttons for combat instead of being hard-coded
* Score mechanic if you win in combat

Currently in progress from the most recent sprint:
* Adding vials that let you regain health

What we still need to complete:
* An end to the game with a boss to defeat
* A boss sprite
* Story elements added to the game


Some bugs we currently have in the program:
* Enemies respawn in room after combat (persistent room / reset state after combat)

Want to have tested
* Weird edge cases for movement
* Fun factor of combat
