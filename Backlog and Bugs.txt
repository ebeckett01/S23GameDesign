For this delivery, we have a partially completed game. So far in our backlog we have completed:
* Movement with both arrow keys and wasd
* Dash and double jump movement
* Level design of a tutorial
* Enemies that can detect when the player is in view and bring the player into combat
* Combat where the player and enemy can attack eachother
* Bushes that the player can hide in
* A pause menu where you can toggle the controls 
* A splash screen menu
Currently in progress from the most recent sprint:
* Adding blocking mechanics that complete the combat
What we still need to complete:
* An end to the game with a boss to defeat
* A polished sprite for the enemies and boss
* Story elements added to the game


Some bugs we currently have in the program:
* The game freezes if you attempt to attack an enemy while dashing
* The player can fall off the map to the left of the tutorial
* Enemy doesn't always die after losing combat
