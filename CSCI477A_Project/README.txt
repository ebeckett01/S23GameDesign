Still left to do:

Likely, we will not finish the last two, but we hope to have a boss (and therefore end of game) and a game name by the full delivery. 

Some current bugs:
The player can get stuck on block or buildings on ht edge occasionally.
The player can fall off the edge
Enemies won't recognize the player occasionally if the player is above them.
